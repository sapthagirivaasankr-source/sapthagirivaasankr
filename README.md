Backend Software Engineer | Java | Spring Boot

---

As a Software Engineer with close to 2+ years of experience, I have a strong interest in building reliable, structured, and scalable backend systems. I mainly work with Java and Spring Boot, and I enjoy developing REST APIs, backend services, and data-processing logic that handle real-world use cases. When I look at a problem, I instinctively think about how data flows through the system, how validations should be handled, and how different components interact with each other. I enjoy breaking down complex requirements into simpler backend services that are easier to understand, maintain, and extend over time.

I believe backend development is not just about making features work, but about making them work consistently and correctly in production environments. Writing clean code, handling edge cases, and thinking about performance and reliability are things I naturally focus on. I like understanding why a system behaves the way it does and how design decisions affect long-term stability.

I am motivated by learning through hands-on experience and real projects rather than just following tutorials. I enjoy improving existing systems, experimenting with backend ideas, and continuously strengthening my understanding of backend architecture and system design. I adapt quickly to new environments, enjoy collaborating with others, and value clear communication and teamwork when working on challenging problems.
